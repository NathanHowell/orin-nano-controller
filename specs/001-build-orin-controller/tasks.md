# Tasks: Build Orin Controller Firmware

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-orin-controller/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
**Validation**: Capture hardware strap, power, and USB evidence on the bench and mirror each REPL workflow via the `emulator` crate with archived host transcripts and parity logs.
**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each story can be implemented and tested independently.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no blocking dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Maps tasks to user stories (US1, US2, US3)
- Always include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Shared logic/API: `controller-core/src/`, `controller-core/Cargo.toml`
- Firmware target: `firmware/src/`, `firmware/Cargo.toml`, `firmware/.cargo/`
- Host emulator: `emulator/src/`, `emulator/Cargo.toml`
- Bench evidence: `specs/001-build-orin-controller/evidence/`
- Hardware docs: `pcb/orin-nano-controller/README.md`
- Feature documentation: `specs/001-build-orin-controller/*.md`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Phase sequencing: Phase 1 (T001â€“T004) â†’ Phase 2 (T005â€“T013) â†’ Phase 3 (US1) â†’ Phase 4 (US2) â†’ Phase 5 (US3) â†’ Phase 6 (T040â€“T047).
- User story prerequisites: US1 (T014â€“T023) depends on foundational tasks; US2 (T024â€“T031) requires completion of T006â€“T013 and queue telemetry from US1; US3 (T032â€“T039) depends on foundational work plus REC telemetry patterns from US2.
- Evidence tasks (T020, T029, T037, T042â€“T046) require corresponding implementation tasks to be merged first.
- Emulator parity logging (T019, T028, T036) depends on the emulator scaffold (T012) and relevant controller-core commands (T016, T027, T034).

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **US1**: After T014 lands, run T016 and T017 in parallel while firmware integration (T018) proceeds, then capture evidence (T020â€“T021) once parity logging (T019) is ready.
- **US2**: Develop bridge telemetry (T026) alongside REPL command parsing (T027) after sequences (T024) are ready, leaving emulator parity (T028) to run once firmware signaling stabilizes.
- **US3**: Implement telemetry updates (T033) and REPL parsing (T034) in parallel after the FaultRecovery template (T032), while firmware integration (T035) prepares for evidence capture (T037).

---

## Implementation Strategy

Follow the plan in `specs/001-build-orin-controller/plan.md`:

1. Stand up the shared `controller-core` abstractions (Phase 2).
2. Bind `controller-core` to the firmware hardware layer and prove emulator parity (Phases 3â€“5 incrementally).
3. Capture bench evidence and telemetry parity for each story before progressing to the next.
4. Close with cross-cutting validation, success criteria measurements, and documentation polish (Phase 6).
